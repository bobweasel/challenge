# WA bot

Need to install whatsapp-web.js and qrcode-terminal

Initialise bot by running the script and scanning the QR code (or insert the key somehow) to sign in

Subsequent runs will not require sign in

Comes with some bot commands, and tasks to fulfill when added to a group will be executed.

Need to create and specify file (default is ./test/test.pdf) to send
